# Chess Board HTML Project

## Description
This is a simple HTML implementation of a chess board using table elements. The board displays the standard starting position for a game of chess with black pieces at the top and white pieces at the bottom.

## Features
- 8x8 chess board with alternating black and white squares
- Correct initial placement of all chess pieces:
  - Black pieces (top rows): ♜♞♝♛♚♝♞♜ and ♟ pawns
  - White pieces (bottom rows): ♖♘♗♕♔♗♘♖ and ♙ pawns
- Empty middle rows representing the playing area
- Responsive design with fixed cell sizes

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- Basic table formatting with `bgcolor`, `align`, `width`, and `height` attributes
- Unicode chess symbols for pieces

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository or download the HTML file
2. Open `index.html` in any web browser
3. View the chess board with all pieces in their starting positions

## Customization
You can easily modify this project by:
- Changing the colors of the squares by editing the `bgcolor` attributes
- Adjusting the size of the board by changing the `width` and `height` values
- Adding JavaScript to make the board interactive
- Implementing piece movement functionality

## Limitations
- Currently static (no interactivity)
- Uses deprecated HTML attributes (bgcolor, font tags)
- No responsive design for different screen sizes

## Future Improvements
- Convert to CSS styling instead of deprecated HTML attributes
- Add JavaScript for piece movement
- Implement game logic and rules
- Add player vs player or player vs computer functionality
